# Youtube-comment-text-analysis

In this project, we have a dataset of user comments for youtube videos related to animals or pets. We will attempt to identify cat or dog owners based on these comments, 
find out the topics important to them, and then identify video creators with the most viewers that are cat or dog owners.

The dataset provided for this project are comments for videos related to animals and/or pets. The dataset is 240MB compressed; please download the file using this google drive link: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o3DsS3jN_t2Mw3TsV0i7ySRmh9kyYi1a/view?usp=sharing

The dataset file is comma separated, with a header line defining the field names, listed here: 

● creator_name. Name of the YouTube channel creator. 

● userid. Integer identifier for the users commenting on the YouTube channels. 

● comment. Text of the comments made by the users.

Please note that this project has originally been carried out in Databricks.
